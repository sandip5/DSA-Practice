Day - 1
1. Find the Kth largest and Kth smallest number in an array
2. Sort the array of 0s, 1s, and 2s
3. Move all the negative elements to one side of the array [Incomplete]
4. Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays
5. Subarray with given Sum [Untouched]

Day - 2
1. Power function
Implement pow(X, N), which calculates x raised to the power N i.e. (X^N). Try using a recursive approach
Input:
2
2.10 3
2.00 -2

Output:
9.26
0.25

Explanation: 2^(-2) = 1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

2. Factorial - Recursion
Find factorial of a given number N.

3. Tower of Hanoi
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have 3 rods and N disks. The puzzle starts with all the disks in ascending order of size on the first row. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
